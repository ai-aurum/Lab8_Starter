## Paragraph on Graceful Degredation and Service Workers:

Service workers are related to the method of graceful degredation in the sense that they provide the user the tools and resources that they need to successfully and effectively run an application. With these resources, the functionality of the app can be "gracefully" trickled down to the back-end, without having to worry about any network issues. In this way, service workers within a web application are essentially analgous to graceful degradation, with service workers being the top of the progress flow.
